Stabbing around on a mound of dirt in your yard
Making it clear you're a total mental retard
All the seeds you have buried deep in your mind
Dig them up like a nut from the ground you'll be fine

Seeds are sprouting again in the sun and the rain
No-one believes that it's any better this way
Grass is up to your knees with roots deep as the trees
The doctors have come and they're ready to take you away

Seeds can lie dormant for over 21 years
The next generation will realize your worst fears
Dig the nuts while you can that's the best you can do
You won't get them all but you might get a few
</pre>
