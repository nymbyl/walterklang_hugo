I don't care if it's raining I've got to go
I got the motor running and one for the road
If you don't want to go with me I'll go alone
I'm going to the next town and I'm going slow

You do it all too well
I believe, I believe I do it all wrong
You put me on the last rung
I'm depreciated and wise to the ways of the world

They say they named the next town after a man
They say he was a savior of the land
Built a chapel and a road and a lot of things out of stone
Then he fell off his horse and that's all they wrote

I'm going oh too slow
Got to kick me hard to get me to go
I believe I'm not the only one who needs a change
I'm depreciated and wise to the ways of the world

Made some long term plans just because I can
Back when I was young had my head in the sand
Now I got me some chlorine burns and cold sores
Must be from all the methane the work and the wars

And it goes all too slow
Got to kick it hard to let it go
I believe I'm not the only one who needs a change
I'm depreciated and wise to the ways of the world

I'm a thin white sidewall just spinning around
I'll see you on the other side should you decide to come down
The fun is all over no need for me to hang around
I got the motor running and I'm off to the next town

You do it all too well
I believe, I believe I do it all wrong
You put me on the last rung
I'm depreciated and wise to the ways of the world
