today is just the day I make the sky
I'm pushing the rain
I'm pushing the rain
I'm pushing the rain back

today I touch the clouds and make them white
I'm pushing the rain
I'm pushing the rain
(can't push the, push the rain back can't keep the clouds away)
I'm pushing the rain back

today I brush the clouds of out of your eyes
I'm pushing the rain
I'm pushing the rain
(can't push the, push the rain back can't keep the clouds away)
I'm pushing the rain back
</pre>
