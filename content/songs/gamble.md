<pre>
You could break me, you could take me out
You could still me, you could turn me down
You could make me broken
You make me older and older
And fold me up into a ball
You could make me stumble
You could make me mumble and swallow my
World until I can't go on

If I didn't know you then I wouldnt take such a gamble

You could crush me, crush me up in sound
You could toy me, you could fake me out
You could make me shattered
You could me scattered about
And across across across the noun
You make me over
You make it up
Again and again again until I'm gone

If I didn't know you then I wouldnt take such a gamble
</pre>
