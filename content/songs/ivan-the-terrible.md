ivan the terrible, ivan the great
ivan the fearesome, ivan the dreaded czar

ruler of the land, ruler of the sea
enemy of the rich, friend to the poor

named his son ivan, that's no surprise
then he killed him, that's filicide

threw all his cats, off the kremlin roof
threw all his dogs, off there too

beat up his daughter-in-law, when she was with child
that made her have a miscarriage, well he's just that kind of guy

when he died he was playing chess, some say he was killed
poisoned by mercury, or maybe it was the syphillis
