<pre>
every time you blink, we fall down
every time you move, we break down
every word you say, we write down
everything you do, we bow down

1,000 men will fall to their knees
1,000 men will bow at your feet
to catch the gold that falls from your eyelashes down

every time you blink, we fall down
everyone you touch, we track down
everything you say, we take down
everyone you fuck, we hunt down

1,000 men will call out your name
1,000 men will go to the grave
to catch the gold that falls from your eyelashes down
