if you wonder whether your
in heaven or in hell
you must be confused because
it isn't hard to tell

  it doesn't take a genius
  it doesn't take too much
  it doesn't take a genius
  to get a cat to know

if you can tie your shoelaces
your feet should do the rest
I could show you everything 
but it's not that hard to guess

  it doesn't take a genius
  it doesn't take too much
  it doesn't take a genius
  to get a cat to know

you can read the book of life
all by yourself
you should know the meaning
nobody has to spell it out

  it doesn't take a genius
  it doesn't take too much
  it doesn't take a genius
  to get a cat to know
