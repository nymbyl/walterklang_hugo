<pre>
she tears the pages from her book of friends
and throws the litter in the air and lets it fall
randomly - and picks a number blind
so whomever she calls its all up to happen-stance
she goes by the name katy-did
she goes by the name katy-did-not-did-not-did

she makes a coffin for the day that she dies
and inside she paints the clouds and sky - and if you
climb inside it feels like you can fly
shes says it's better to have flown that way
than to never have flown at all
she goes by the name katy-did
she goes by the name katy-did-not-did-not-did
