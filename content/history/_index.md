## History

### 1991
In the Fall of 1991 Chad Himmel and Rob Nelson
had both written about 20-30 songs apiece. So they
decided to go in a recording studio to record some
of those songs, [Crude Material](/albums/crude-material "Crude Material")
is what resulted, a collection of 10 acoustic songs featuring
Andy ("Man of Science and Adventure") Laska on percussion.
They decided to call the band *Alter Klang*
after a Paul Klee painting. And released the songs on
cassette.
    
### 1992-1994
A year later Rob Nelson moved to Austin and 
*Alter Klang* continued. They teamed up with Mike and Dub and
recorded 100s of hours of music and close to 100 songs. 
This was a prolific time between 1992-1994.  Some of this 
music is stored away on reel-to-reel 8 tracks somewhere.  
However nothing quite materialized from the all the effort, 
and much of the music was lost. Somewhere in here 
the name of the band changed to **Walter Klang**
    
### 1995-1996
In 1995 two of the members left, so Chad Himmel and Rob Nelson booked some time in a recording studio to try and document some of the music
that had emerged over the proceeding 2 years.  In the Fall of
1995 they reserved 2 days at *Breakfast Surreal Studios* in Austin, Texas (run by Lowell Smith).  They managed to record 21 songs at that time.  This was consolidated down to a single collection of 13
songs and called [Whether Be Petrified](/albums/whether-be-petrified "Whether Be Petrified")
      
In 1996 they returned to *Breakfast Surreal* twice.
First in the Spring and then in the Summer. In the Spring
they booked the studio for 2 days and recorded the 12 songs
that make up
[Further Travels (of Pinnatley Frond)](/albums/further-travels)
      
Later that Summer they visited the studios one more time.  This time booking 4 days. In an ambitious project they recorded
23 songs.  It was consolidated down to one collection and
entitled 
[The Escape of the Children](/albums/the-escape-of-the-children "The Escape of the Children")

### 1997-2001
In 1997 the members of Walter Klang had dispersed across
the United States - from Seattle to Nashville to
New York to San Antonio. So it seemed like that was the end of the
story
  
### 2001-2009

By 2001 three of the original members had returned to Austin - so 
the band reformed.  Just like the 1992-1994 period
they have recorded 100s of hours of music - and nothing has quite materialized.  This time the music has been recorded digitally 
so it is not buried on reel-to-reel tapes. This site contains 
a record of all those recordings starting from May, 2001.
